    <section>
        <p>The day I joined college, it felt like stepping into an entirely new world. After years of formal schooling, where everything was predictable, I found myself in an environment filled with possibilities, challenges, and new faces. As a first-year student pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, my journey has been both exciting and overwhelming. In this blog, I’ll take you through the major changes and experiences that have shaped my life since I joined college.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Adapting to a New Environment</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest adjustments was the transition from school to college. The shift from a rigid schedule to a more flexible one took some getting used to. Initially, it was hard to balance the freedom that college offers with the responsibility of managing my time effectively. The challenge wasn’t just in academics but also in managing extracurricular activities, socializing, and maintaining my personal space.</p>
        <p>The first few weeks were all about figuring out how to organize my day, especially since I had to commute for two hours to get to college. However, this downtime turned out to be productive. I started using my time in the metro to study and revise, making use of the one hour I had each way. This helped me find a rhythm in my daily routine.</p>

        <h2>2. The Academic Roller Coaster</h2>
        <p>The academic aspect of college has been an entirely new ball game. Unlike school, where most of the material is spoon-fed, in college, I had to be more proactive in learning. The coursework in AI and Data Science is challenging, but it's also incredibly fascinating. I’ve had to dive deep into subjects like Machine Learning, Python programming, and even complex areas like C programming.</p>
        <p>The pressure is real, especially when deadlines and assignments start piling up. One of the most demanding assignments was related to C programming, but it was also one of the most rewarding when I finally understood the concepts. The constant practice and exposure to new technologies have broadened my skills. I’ve also started learning tools like MySQL and Dart, which are essential for future projects and internships.</p>

        <h2>3. The Rise of Self-Learning</h2>
        <p>While college provides the foundation, much of the learning happens outside the classroom. This is where the real fun begins. I’ve made it a point to follow online courses and participate in challenges to deepen my knowledge. I enrolled in the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera, which has been an incredible resource for expanding my skills in machine learning and AI.</p>
        <p>Self-learning has also been key when it comes to coding. I've spent time refining my coding skills, diving into open-source projects, and contributing to GitHub. This has not only enhanced my technical skills but also introduced me to a community of like-minded people. Moreover, I’ve found coding to be therapeutic, as it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I solve problems or build something new.</p>

        <h2>4. Building Connections</h2>
        <p>Another aspect of college life that I never expected was how important networking would be. During the first few months, I met a lot of people with diverse interests and backgrounds. Some of them became study partners, while others turned into good friends. Collaborating with peers like Krishna and Pratik on the AI-based attendance system project has been a rewarding experience.</p>
        <p>I also realized the importance of finding mentors. Professors, alumni, and industry professionals have been incredibly supportive in guiding me on my career path. This is why I decided to pursue internships and projects that could provide me with real-world experience, which will be essential when I begin applying for positions, such as those at companies like Netflix after my 4th semester.</p>

        <h2>5. Challenges and Perseverance</h2>
        <p>College life is not always smooth sailing. There have been days when I felt overwhelmed with assignments, exams, and projects. The key has been perseverance. Whether it’s preparing for exams like my upcoming prelims or working through technical difficulties in my projects, I’ve learned to push through and not let setbacks define my journey.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was managing time effectively. With my classes, assignments, projects, and personal life, it was easy to feel scattered. However, creating a schedule that includes focused study sessions, coding practice, and time for self-care has been crucial in staying on top of things.</p>

        <h2>6. The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>Looking ahead, my college journey is just beginning. I have plans to secure internships in the machine learning field and to build projects that will shape my career. My goal is to pursue my master's degree at the National University of Singapore and eventually start a business in Singapore. The skills I’m gaining now, both in academics and extracurricular activities, are helping me build a strong foundation for my future.</p>
        <p>In the end, college is all about growth—personal, academic, and professional. The experiences and lessons I’ve learned so far have only fueled my determination to make the most of this chapter of my life.</p>
        <p>As I continue my journey, I’m excited for what the future holds. It’s not just about getting good grades or acing assignments; it’s about evolving as an individual and making the most of the opportunities that come my way. College life has been challenging, but it’s also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.</p>
        <p>If you’re just starting college, embrace every moment, be open to new opportunities, and never stop learning—because this is just the beginning of something incredible.</p>
